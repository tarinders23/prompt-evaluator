## Exercise 1: Introduction to Zero-Shot Prompting


**Objective:** Understand how to get a direct answer from an LLM without providing examples.


Zero-shot prompting involves asking the LLM to perform a task directly, relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge. It's the simplest form of prompting.


**Task:** Write a prompt that asks the LLM to summarize the key benefits of cloud computing in a single paragraph. Focus on clarity and conciseness.
